RadioBase
=========
Project Overview
-------------
RadioBase is a project which aims to serve as a hub for community run radio stations. 

The first part of the app is the scraper. The scraper grabs the playlists from the stations' websites, the biography of each artist from EchoNest, the YouTube video from YouTube, before finally saving it in the database. 

The second part of the app consists of a front end and backend where the user can select the radio station, then the specific program, and finally a specific playlist. On the last page, the user is able to select the song which then displays the music video and biography.
