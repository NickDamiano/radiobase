            "biography": "Part of the mid-1980s British indie pop boom, The Flatmates were part of the Subway Organization, a Bristol record label formed by Martin Whitehead, who was also guitarist and main songwriter for the band.  Following the band's formation in 1985, singles such as I Could be in Heaven, Happy All the Time and Shimmer established the band as potentially one of the most successful indie bands of the time, but the Flatmates disbanded in early 1989 before releasing a proper studio album.  The band's core members were: Martin Whitehead (Guitar) and Debbie Haynes (Vocals). Initially, the band also included: Kath Beach (Bass guitar - replaced by Sarah Fletcher then by Jackie Carrera); Rocker (Drums - replaced by Joel O'Beirne) and Tim Rippington (Guitar).  Two collections of Flatmates material have been released on CD, Love and Death (1989) and Potpourri (Hits, Mixes and Demos '85 - '89) (2005). Love and Death has endured several pressings over the years, most recently reissued on the US label Clairecords."

After being renamed the Grifters (after the novel by Jim Thompson) by 1990, Shouse joined Taylor on guitar, with Stanley Gallimore taking over on the drums. Songwriting duties were shared between Shouse, Taylor and Lamkins. For several years in the 1990s they recorded primarily at Easley McCain Recording and were closely affiliated with Memphis' Shangri-La Records label for a time."

            "album": "Our New Day",
            "biography": "Formed at the tail end of '96 from the ashes of The Lyds, The Embrooks are the hottest freakbeat trio the UK has to offer!! Since their inception a little under 12 (!!) years ago, the band have gone from strength to strength, discarding their initial \"moody teen punk\" approach in favour of something a touch more NOW and HAPPENING, drawing on influences ranging from The Who and The Creation through to The Byrds and Mike Stuart Span (to name but a few). The line-up remains unchanged since the start, consisting of: Mole (ex-The Mystreated/Stewed) on bass/vocals, Dr. Alessandro Cozzi Lepri (ex-Head & The Hares) on guitar/vocals, and Miss Lois Tozer (ex-Hellcats UK/Dirty Burds) on drums.  The band's output so far consists of 4 45s and 2 LPs: the first 45, 'But I Didn't Know Him'/'Fight Fire' on Dig The Fuzz, was a limited press (now sold out), while the second, a 4 track EP simply titled 'The Embrooks', was put out in late summer '98 by Sympathy For The Record Industry (but was recorded way back in Dec. '96, just one month after the formation of the band). The aforementioned debut long player, titled 'Separations', was released April '99 on Dig The Fuzz (and recorded, like the 2 45s, on 4-track at the famed Terrace Studios). This monstrous 12 incher was re-released in October 2000 by Dionysus, in a remixed format for the US market. September '99 saw a new single, 'More Than Ever'/'You Can Be My Baby', released by Guerssen Records in Spain (originally scheduled for Dig The Fuzz), and, in January 2000, a 3-track EP for Swiss label Max Picou, 'If You Let Me Go' (recorded at the same Toe Rag session as the Spanish single, in March '99). July 2000 has seen the release of the 2nd LP, 'Our New Day', on Bomp subsidiary Voxx (also the band's first venture into CD, along with the Dionysus album), whilst in November, the band made their first sampler appearance, on fledgling label Trepanner Headmusic's debut release, a 5-track 10\" EP entitled 'Open Up Your Head', which features Bangtwister, Gorilla, Moniack and Greathead Briggs, alongside The Embrooks tearing through The Yardbirds' '68 B-side, 'Think About It'.  On the live front, the band spent much of '98 (and some of '97) making inroads into Europe, with 2 short tours in Germany as well as one-offs in Italy (at the legendary Festival Beat) and Spain. Various UK dates were also undertaken, mostly in the north of England (Liverpool, Newcastle, Nottingham etc.), with a few London dates thrown in, including the Wild Weekend in October '98, in front of an enthusiastic crowd at The Red Eye pub. The second half of '99 saw a marked increase in live shows, with 5 appearances through July, in London (Garage), Belgium (twice!), Leicester and Nottingham (at the famed Fuzz Fest), 3 in August - London again (Hope & Anchor), Maidstone, plus an afternoon slot at the New Untouchables Mod Rally on the Isle of Wight, then September saw a return to the Garage in London, followed by a short tour in France and Spain, taking in Nantes, Lleida, Gijon, Burgos, Madrid and Leon (at the Purple Weekend International Mod Festival).  October/November '99 saw the band take what could be its' most important step so far: America!!! After being penciled in at the last minute to open the Sunday night show at the Las Vegas Grind (provoking rave reviews and being one of the best received acts there), 3 dates in California followed - San Diego (3rd Nov), LA (4th) and San Francisco (5th), confirming what those in Las Vegas already suspected, that the band were a force to be reckoned with! Picking up label interest along the way from Dionysus and Bomp, this has been The Embrooks' most successful venture to date!"

            "biography": "Verona or vrn, is a rock band formed in Punto Fijo at the end of 2000, by Chevy (guitars and vocals), Atari (guitar and backing vocals), Paúl Jatem (bass guitar) and Eduardo (drums). In 2001, they recorded their first EP, Delirium, which included earlier recordings from Chevy. Paúl left the band in 2003 and was replaced by Adolfo Alcala. Alcala was credited with the composition of Verona's first LP, Summer Consequence, but he left before its recording. He was replaced by Ray Diaz in December 2003. In May 2004, Verona released Summer Consequence. The band, with the same members, released its second LP, Anywhere in March 2008. \n\nMoving to Caracas and Delirium EP (2000-2002):\nIn October 2001, Verona began to record \"Delirium\" and \"Pagina Ven\", two of the five songs that appeared on the Delirium EP. The other songs, \"Hoy\", \"Make a Wish\" and \"Automatic\", were recordings from Chevy's first solo project. The EP was never officially released but distributed between friends and online through their first web page. At the end of the year, Verona moved to Caracas looking for better opportunities and places to perform. \nVerona ceased activities in 2002 due to other commitments of the members. They were back in Caracas at the Jim Morrison Festival, their first show there. \n\nSummer Consequence (2003-2004):\nVerona recruited Adolfo Alcala after Paul Jatem left the band in 2003. Alcala was an important member since he helped the band to establish in the underground movement in the city. One of the most important shows of that year was the \"Alma Mater Festival\" where they left a memorable impression on the audience and press. \nAlcala left the band for academic reasons in 2003 and was replaced by E.W.'s former bass guitar player, Ray Diaz. Diaz was not very involved with Verona's musical influences, but he turned out to fit in very well with the band. He said in 2003, \"I'm not familiar with Verona's influences, but I will do my best to contribute in whatever I can.\" At this point, he was not confirmed as a full-time member of Verona, but he filled in on bass guitar for live shows and their first LP recording, Summer Consequence. This new album was produced by Verona's first bass guitar player, Paul Jatem, and the band itself. It was released on May 20, 2004. \nSummer Consequence has eleven songs, including re-mastered versions of \"Make a Wish\" and \"Delirium\" from the Delirium EP which was not officially released. Chevy said, \"We like this two songs, it would be a shame having them recorded and not give them the appropriate distribution.\" Summer Consequence received very positive reviews from critics, including several reviews by Rolling Stone Latin America magazine; it was included as one of their Best 50 Albums of 2004. \nIn October 2004, when Diaz was officially announced as a full-time member of the band, they started filming their first music video, for the single \"Beautiful\". Atari (also in charge of the band's image), was the director along with Vanessa Henriquez and VJ Zion. \"Beautiful\"'s video was first shown on national television on June 5, 2004. \n\n\"Anywhere\" and \"Mark of Excellence\" single (2005-2008):\n\nIn mid-2005, Verona went back to the studio to record demos that in the end became an album. They recorded four tracks: \"Wondering Mind\", \"Broken Promise\", \"I'm you\" and a new wave version of \"Make a Wish\". \"Wondering Mind\" was the first song completely composed by the four members of the band. \nIn late 2005, Verona took another big break. Goitia and Diaz played a couple of shows with their former bands, while Chevy and Atari were focused on solo recordings. \nIn 2006, Verona continued recording their songs and finished by the end the year. In the beginning, the album was thought to have two songs in Spanish, including a version of \"Mourning Days\" and \"Dead or Alive\" (unreleased). \"Dead or Alive\" was excluded from the album and was replaced by \"Mark of Excellence\", which was composed by Atari and Chevy. Chevy said, \"We initially thought that recording something in Spanish would work for us, we'd probably get radio airtime, but this is not what Verona is about.\" Atari added, \"In the other hand, Mark of Excellence defines this new process that we are going through, this is the music style we have always been looking for...\" \nAnywhere included guest appearances by Håkan Löfdahl (the lead singer in the Swedish band The Last Hours) and Jean Carlo de Oliveira (Candy 66's lead singer). All tracks were mixed by Jean Carlo de Oliveira, except for \"Mark of Excellence\" which was mixed by Håkan Löfdahl and \"Piano for a Friend\", mixed by Juan Carlos Nieto. \n\"Mark of Excellence\" was released on May 25, 2007. to the band's surprise, the song received airtime nationwide,making Verona the first Venezuelan English singing band to achieve this. Venezuela's laws states that: \"local bands have to follow certain rules in order to get airtime, which include singing in Spanish. Airtime in the country is divided in two, 70% Spanish singing national bands and 30% for other languages and international bands\". This single was included in that 30% competing with the best bands around the world. \"Mourning Days\" also received airtime as Anywhere's second single. \nOn October 5, 2007, Verona won an Urbe award for \"Best Non-Capital Band\", i.e. nominated and voted by the public as the best band in Venezuela that is not from Caracas. Verona could not compete in the nomination for \"Best Capital Band\" since all band members are from another state. \nOn March 20, 2008, Anywhere\" was released. It has 1twelve tracks. Urbe magazine (the most important alternative newspaper in the country) placed Anywhere in the top five albums in Venezuela. \nTo support the release of Anywhere, Verona started a national tour which also included three acoustic live performances in California and Florida. A successful Stone Temple Pilots tribute in Caracas, sponsored by La Mega Radio Station, followed the tour. \n\n\"Silent Night\" cover and new album recording (2009):\nVerona has not worked together since their last show in 2009, although they have been seen together in a few concerts; Atari made a special guest appearance at The Ataris show on July 22. He was invited to play guitars in \"Takeoffs and Landings\" and \"In this Diary\" while the Indiana band performed in Caracas as a part of their Latin American tour. \nThe band occasionally gets together in studios to record their next album. \nDuring the process of recording this new material, they recorded a Christmas cover song that was included in their December set list, Josef Mohr's \"Silent Night\". It was released for free download on December 3 on the band's official website. \nMeanwhile Diaz and Goitia participated in Mike Lemus' solo project and No Refuse's band in Punto Fijo. \n\nSXSW, Diaz and \"Alibis & Paybacks\" CDS (2010-present):\nIn December 2009, Verona received an invitation to play at SXSW (South by Southwest) in Austin, Texas. This festival showcases hundreds of musical artists from around the world. Verona's showcase was on the Opal Divine's Freehouse venue. \nOn April 19, 2010, Diaz was formally announced as Candy 66's new bass guitar player on their official web page. He left Verona on September 11, 2010. \nOn May 2, 2012, Verona released the first single, \"Alibis & Paybacks\", from their upcoming album. \n\nMembers:\n\nCurrent:\nChevy - lead vocals, guitar, keyboards, \nAtari - guitar, backing vocals, keyboards, \nEduardo Goitia - drums, percussion, \n\nFormer:\nPaúl Jatem - bass guitar, \nAdolfo Alcalá - bass guitar, \nRay Díaz - bass guitar"

Mike Low left the band to be replaced by guitarist and vocalist Helios Creed, the band released Alien Soundtracks, the project of which started out as a soundtrack for a radical San Francisco strip show.

Following Alien Soundtracks, John Lambdin left Chrome, and Gary Spain gradually played less of an active role in the band, leaving a core of Helios Creed and Damon Edge to explore their own experiments with new members. The Creed/Edge collaboration lead to a number of more albums, including Half Machine Lip Moves (making best album lists by Wire Magazine and Julian Cope), Read Only Memory, Red Exposure, Blood On The Moon, 3rd From The Sun and No Humans Allowed.  In 1983 Edge moved to Paris with his wife, where he formed a new lineup of Chrome, releasing a number of albums without Helios Creed, starting with Into the Eyes of the Zombie King, until Edge's death in 1995. Helios Creed formed a new version of Chrome with both new and previous members, shortly after Edge's passing. The Helios-lead Chrome releasing their first album, Retro Transmission, in 1997, and have never officially broken up. They also toured from 1997 to 2001.

Memorable gigs so far include Pikes House in Ibiza for Ibiza Rocks, Proud Camden and Club Fandango.  Visitors debut single 'Oxygen' tells the story of a Jekyll and Hyde Prime Minister and a revolution to free the people from a country that pays to breathe.

With a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, boa constrictors, and baby dolls, he is considered by fans and peers alike to be \"The Godfather of Shock Rock\"; Cooper has drawn equally from horror movies, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a grandly theatrical and macabre brand of rock designed to shock.  Originating in Phoenix in the late 1960s after Furnier moved from Detroit, Alice Cooper was originally a band consisting of Furnier on vocals and harmonica, lead guitarist Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar, Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar, and drummer Neal Smith. The original Alice Cooper band broke into the international music mainstream with the 1971 hit \"I'm Eighteen\" from the album Love It to Death, which was followed by the even bigger single \"School's Out\" in 1972. The band reached their commercial peak with the 1973 album Billion Dollar Babies.  Furnier adopted the band's name as his own name in the 1970s and began a solo career with the 1975 concept album Welcome to My Nightmare. In 2011 he released Welcome 2 My Nightmare, his 19th album as a solo artist, and his 26th album in total. Expanding from his Detroit rock roots, in his career Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles, including conceptual rock, art rock, hard rock, heavy metal, new wave, pop rock, experimental rock and industrial rock."

            "biography": "Gossip (formerly The Gossip) is a three-piece American indie rock band formed in 1999 in Olympia, Washington. The band consists of singer Beth Ditto, guitarist Brace Paine and drummer Hannah Blilie. After releasing several recordings, the band broke through with their 2006 studio album, Standing in the Way of Control (2006). A follow-up, Music for Men, was released in 2009. The band plays a mix of post-punk revival, indie rock, and dance-rock. Their latest album, A Joyful Noise, was released in May 2012. \n\nHistory:\n\nFormation and early history:\nGossip was formed in 1999 in Olympia, Washington, with vocalist Beth Ditto, guitarist Nathan \"Brace Paine\" Howdeshell and drummer Kathy Mendonça. All three were originally from Searcy, Arkansas; Mendonça moved to Olympia to attend Evergreen State College and Howdeshell and Ditto followed. Howdeshell and Mendonça had been in bands together in Arkansas. The band coalesced when the three members were roommates in Olympia. \nIn 1999 the independent record label K Records released Gossip's first recording, their eponymous debut EP, The Gossip to coincide with the band's tour with Sleater-Kinney. The band played at the first Ladyfest in Olympia in August 2000 and was included in Time Magazine's article on the festival. \nTheir next release was their first album, That's Not What I Heard, released by the record label Kill Rock Stars on January 23, 2001. They followed it with the EP Arkansas Heat on May 7, 2002. Movement, their second studio album, was released on May 6, 2003. In November 2003, two months after the release of their first live album Undead in NYC on September 9, drummer Kathy Mendonça left the band to pursue a career as a midwife. Established punk drummer Hannah Blilie joined to replace her. The band then dropped the \"The\" from their name, continuing as plain \"Gossip\". \nThe first release featuring new drummer Hannah Blilie was the band's next album Standing in the Way of Control. It was released on January 24, 2006 on Kill Rock Stars and later in 2006 on UK independent label Back Yard Recordings. It was produced by Ryan Hadlock, owner of Bear Creek Studio and Fugazi singer/guitarist Guy Picciotto. \n\n2007-2011: Mainstream success and moving to a major label:\n\nThe album Standing in the Way of Control has since earned Gold Record Status in the UK. Gossip's first UK TV appearance was on BBC1's Friday Night With Jonathan Ross, where they performed \"Standing in the Way of Control\". \nAs reported on Pitchfork Media in March 2007, the group signed to Music With a Twist, a subsidiary of Sony Music Label Group, concentrating on LGBT music acts. During the summer of 2007, Gossip was a part of the multi-artist True Colors Tour 2007, which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada. Hosted by comedian Margaret Cho and headlined by Cyndi Lauper, the tour also included Debbie Harry, Erasure, Rufus Wainwright, The Dresden Dolls, The MisShapes, The Cliks and special guests. Profits from the tour went to benefit the Human Rights Campaign. \nGossip is based in Portland, Oregon and has played with bands such as Sleater-Kinney, Le Tigre, CSS, Erase Errata, Mika Miko, Panther, Comanechi, and Mates of State. Gossip also opened for the Scissor Sisters for three dates on their November 2006 tour. \nOn June 24, 2007 Gossip closed the Glastonbury Festival, playing the final set on the John Peel stage during which Ditto gave a tribute to the late John Peel. Gossip also performed the following year, on the Pyramid Stage. \nGossip launched the Live in Liverpool album in the UK and the U.S. in April 2008. The album was produced by Rick Rubin and also features a DVD of their live performance. A new studio album called Music For Men was released in June 2009. The first single from the album, \"Heavy Cross\", was especially successful in Germany where it was certified triple gold  for selling over 450,000 copies and was mentioned as the \"most successful internationally produced single\" of all time in September 2010. In January 2011 the single broke the German record for the longest selling track in chart history. By 14 January 2011 it had spent 82 consecutive weeks within the German Top 100. \n\n2012-present: A Joyful Noise:\nOn March 12, 2012, their comeback single, \"Perfect World\", was unveiled on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show. Their fifth studio album A Joyful Noise, produced by Xenomania's Brian Higgins, was released in late May. Their music had evolved and became poppier. Andy Gill, writing in The Independent, welcomed the result where as Pitchfork's review was more nuanced. A second single \"Move in the Right Direction\", was issued in May. During the summer, the band headlined various festivals. \nThe song \"Heavy Cross\" featured in the Dior J'adore TV Spots. \n\nMusical style:\nTheir style has been described as \"a soul or gospel\" voice with \"a sort of funky punk soundtrack\". The band stated a liking for rock bands like Birthday Party,Siouxsie and the Banshees,Nirvana and The Raincoats but also for other genres such as dance and hip hop."

The band's members were Dave Flick (Dave Faulkner) on guitar and vocals, James Baker (drums) and Rudolph V (Dave Cardwell) on bass. \nBaker and Cardwell had both been members of The Geeks, formed in early 1977 with Ross Buncle on guitar and a vocalist known as Lloyd. That band folded when Baker and Cardwell left to form The Victims with Faulkner, who then referred to himself as Dave Flick. The Geeks' repertoire of original songs formed the core of the Victims' initial repertoire. \nIn 1977, The Victims released their debut single, \"Television Addict\" (Faulkner/Baker)/\"I'm Flipped Out Over You\" (Baker/Buncle), of which only 1,000 copies were pressed. The following year they released an EP entitled simply The Victims (also known as No Thanks to the Human Turd), which included five tracks: \"I Understand\", \"Open Your Eyes\", \"TV Freak\", \"High School Girls\" and \"Disco Junkies\". Baker was one of the writers of these songs; the identity of his co-composer is disputed, with some sources claiming that it was Faulkner and others Buncle. Only 500 copies of the EP were released. \nBaker went on to play in the first lineups of The Hoodoo Gurus and The Scientists. Faulkner was also a founding member of The Hoodoo Gurus. \nIn 1989, a compilation album, All Loud on the Western Front was released. It included all the songs from their single and EP, as well as \"Perth is a Culture Shock\". The album was re-issued on CD in 2005. \n\"Television Addict\" has been recorded by Hoodoo Gurus, You Am I, The Hellacopters and Teengenerate. It is also a mainstay of Australian punk compilations. The song was also played live by US band The Bronx on their 2007 Australian tour."

            "biography": "The Chills are a guitar and keyboard-based rock band from Dunedin, New Zealand. The band is essentially the continuing project of singer/songwriter Martin Phillipps, who is the group's sole constant member--for a time in the 1990s, the act was billed as Martin Phillipps & The Chills. In the 1980s and 1990s, The Chills had some significant chart success in their homeland, and were a cult band in other parts of the world as one of the earliest proponents of the Dunedin Sound. \n\nHistory:\n\nEarly years and first break-up (1980-1983):\nSinger-songwriter Martin Phillipps formed The Chills in 1980 with his sister Rachel Phillipps on keyboards and Jane Dodd on bass after the demise of his punk band, The Same. Also included in the initial line-up were guitarist Peter Gutteridge and drummer Alan Haig. Phillipps' earlier band, the Same, had formed in 1978 and performed alongside punk bands Toy Love and The Enemy. \nThe Chills were initially signed by Flying Nun Records and were one of the four bands recorded for the Dunedin Double EP in 1982. By this time, the band consisted of Martin Phillipps, Alan Haig, keyboard player Frazer Batts and bassist Terry Moore. \nRachel Phillipps returned (replacing Batts) and Martyn Bull took over from Haig on drums in time for the band's first single \"Rolling Moon\", which was a chart hit in 1983. However, Bull's sudden illness caused the band to then take a year off. \n\nReformation and international success (1984-1992):\nAfter Bull's death in July 1983 (from leukemia), the Chills changed their name to A Wrinkle in Time, as Phillipps was initially unwilling to continue performing under a name associated with his late friend. The name change was brief, though they did perform live under the alternative name. No recordings were released as A Wrinkle in Time. \nOnce the Chills name had been re-established, from this point forward The Chills were essentially a solo project spearheaded by Martin Phillipps, the band's lead singer and only songwriter. Band personnel turnover was near-constant, with The Chills going through over 20 different line-up changes with Phillipps as the only constant member. Members of the band from 1984 on have included Terry Moore, Alan Haig, Peter Allison, David Kilgour, Steven Schayer, Martin Kean, Justin Harwood, Caroline Easther, Jimmy James Stephenson, Jillian Dempster among others. Several of these musicians went on to further success in bands ranging from The Verlaines to Luna. \nThe band's first post-Wrinkle In Time release was the 1984 single \"Pink Frost\", which became the band's biggest hit to that time. It was initially recorded in 1982 by the three-piece band of Martin Phillipps, Terry Moore and Martyn Bull, before receiving new overdubs in 1984. This single was followed by the single (and #12 hit) \"Doledrums\", then a 6-song EP called The Lost EP. This EP did not feature any of the band's previous or future singles, and itself peaked at #4 on the New Zealand singles charts in 1985. The Chills undertook their first European tour that same year. \nIn 1986, the band issued the minor international hit \"I Love My Leather Jacket\", recorded at The Point Studio, by Danny Hyde. \"I Love My Leather Jacket\" was dedicated to late drummer, Bull, who had bequeathed the said item of clothing to Phillipps in his will. The Chills finally released their first album, Kaleidoscope World, in 1986; the album was a compilation of various previously released singles, EP tracks and songs from the Dunedin Double EP. \nThe band released their first proper album, Brave Words in 1987. The band spent most of 1987 (February through mid-December) promoting the album by touring Europe, interspersed with 4 July dates in New York and Boston. A full-fledged North American tour occurred in the fall of 1988; tour dates would be a regular part of the band's life for the next several years. \nIn 1990, the band were signed to a worldwide record deal with the their music appearing on the Warner Brothers imprint Slash Records in North America. Their 1990 album Submarine Bells included their biggest international hit, the whimsically titled \"Heavenly Pop Hit\". The tune was also a hit in the US, as it charted at #17 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart; it remains their only American chart appearance. The group's follow-up album, 1992's Soft Bomb, featured a totally different Chills line-up (save for Phillipps), and spun off the hit \"The Male Monster From The Id\". \n\nSecond reformation (1995-present):\n\nPhillipps announced the dissolution of the Chills after the Soft Bomb tour, and joined David Kilgour in a loosely organized covers band known as The Pop Art Toasters, which released a self-titled EP in 1994. Shortly thereafter, though, the 'Toasters dissolved, and Phillipps put together another Chills line-up and resumed gigging. \nThis seemingly constant turnover of personnel is often cited as one of several reasons for the band's lack of consistent \"saleability\", and is referred to by the local music scene as \"the curse of the Chills\". The \"curse\" struck again with the recording of the album Sunburnt in England, in the summer of 1995. Two band members were refused entry into the UK, so session musicians had to be recruited at the last moment. Dave Mattacks of Fairport Convention and XTC's Dave Gregory provided drum and bass work for the album, with Phillipps the only other credited musician (aside from guest keyboards played by producer Craig Leon). This album was issued in early 1996 under the group name Martin Phillipps and The Chills. \nAfter that the band again split, with Phillipps appearing in another one of David Kilgour's bands, the Heavy Eights. Nevertheless, Phillipps continued to recruit new Chills members for live shows, and played at least a few shows as The Chills every year from 1997 on. For much of the late 1990s, though, Phillipps was laid low with hepatitis, a side effect of drug addiction problems. He released an album of solo home demos (Sketch Book: Volume One) in 1999; the demos themselves dated from between 1988 and 1995. In 2000, a 3-CD box set of Chills live tracks, demos, radio sessions and rarities appeared, entitled Secret Box. \nIn 2004, an 8-song Chills mini-album called Stand By was issued, the first all-new Chills material in 9 years. Phillipps' album liner notes promised: \n\n\"I am preparing to take the band in quite a new direction on the next album. And on that we will begin work shortly.\" \n\nDespite Phillipps' claim, however, no new Chills album has yet appeared. \nIn May 2010 the band played two shows in Australia, their first shows outside New Zealand since 1996. Three years later, after another 9-year hiatus from the recording studio, a single newly recorded Chills track called \"Molten Gold\" was issued. The track was made available as a digital release only, and was released on Martin Phillipps 50th birthday (July 2, 2013)."

            "biography": "Roxy Music is a British art rock group which formed in 1971 in London, England. Led throughout by Bryan Ferry (vocals, keyboards), the band attained popular and critical success in Europe and Australia during the 1970s and early 1980s, beginning with their 1972 eponymous debut album. Over its time, the band has been highly influential as leading proponents of the more genre-bending, musically-sophisticated elements of glam rock, as well as providing a model for many new wave acts and experimental electronic groups of the early 1980s.   The band's original lineup consisted of Bryan Ferry (vocals, keyboards), Phil Manzanera (guitar), Andy Mackay (saxophone, oboe), Brian Eno (synthesizer, \"treatments\"), Graham Simpson (bass) and Paul Thompson (drums, percussion). Simpson left the band in 1972, and Eno left in 1973. After Eno left the band, he was replaced by Eddie Jobson (synthesizer, violin).  Roxy Music were a significant influence on the early English punk movement, as well as providing a model for many \"New Wave\" acts and the subsequent New Romantic and experimental electronic groups of the early 1980s. Ferry and co-founding member Brian Eno have also had broadly influential solo careers. Brian Eno has emerged as one of the most significant record producers of the late 20th century, with credits including landmark albums by David Bowie, Devo, Talking Heads, The Slits, and U2. Eno is widely credited for coining the term - ambient music - and has collaborated with, and/or produced such important artists as Daniel Lanois,Harold Budd, David Byrne, Robert Fripp  (King Crimson ), Cluster, Jon Hassell, and Jah Wobble, among many others.   The group's name was partly an homage to the titles of old cinemas and dance halls, and partly a pun on the word 'rock'. Ferry had first named the band Roxy, but learning of an American band with the same name prompted the alteration of the name. The juxtaposition of nostalgia with contemporary or futuristic themes was a distinctive feature of the band, particularly in their earliest incarnation. The group is noted for their combination of idiosyncratic experimentation and sophisticated wit, evident in their literate lyrics, restrained instrumental virtuosity, and highly developed visual presentation, mainly directed by Ferry, that expropriated imagery from the realms of high fashion, kitsch, and commercial photography.  During the 1970s, Roxy Music emerged as one of the foremost bands of the time, popular throughout the UK and Europe. In the USA, Australasia and other regions, the band was esteemed by critics and enjoyed an ardent cult following, but they remained little-known among the general public until the 1980s, when they received attention for their cover of the John Lennon song \"Jealous Guy,\" which became their biggest hit.  Later, with more sombre and carefully-sculpted soundscapes, the band's eighth and (until their 21st Century reunion) final album Avalon in 1982, was a major commercial success and restored the group's critical reputation (Rolling Stone: \"Avalon takes a long time to kick in, but it finally does, and it's a good one.\") Roxy Music toured extensively until 1983, when Bryan Ferry dissolved the band and band members devoted themselves full time to solo careers.  Roxy Music reunited for a concert tour in 2001 (minus Eno), and later returned to the stage for a live performance at the 2005 Isle of Wight Festival on Saturday 11 June 2005. On 2 July 2005, Roxy Music played \"Jealous Guy\", \"Do the Strand\" and \"Love is the Drug\" at the Berlin contribution to Live 8; only \"Do the Strand\" was available on the DVD.  During July 2006, the band toured Europe. They concentrated mostly on places they had never visited before, such as Serbia and Macedonia. Roxy Music's second drummer, Andy Newmark, performed during the tour, as Thompson withdrew due to health issues.  Over the summer of 2010, Roxy Music headlined at various festivals across the world, including Lovebox at London's Victoria Park, Electric Picnic in Stradbally, Co. Laois, Ireland, and Bestival on the Isle of Wight. Thompson missed three dates of the tour due to illness, and was once more replaced by Andy Newmark. However, Thompson returned for the band's Bestival set.  In the January 2011 edition of Uncut Magazine, Ferry did not rule out the possibility of new Roxy material, revealing that he would be interested in doing something \"more experimental; a soundtrack or something.\""
